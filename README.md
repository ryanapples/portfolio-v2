The second iteration of ryanapples.io built with Create React App and deployed through Netlify.

### ðŸ’­

Hello world! I finally reconnected with a neglected task a couple of weeks ago, and can proudly present my first personal project for 2022 - ryanapples.io v2. During the course of development, I was able to recall the fun building projects for yourself - client-based or spur of the moment. Cheers to more creativity and growth this year! xx Ryan
